# ConfirmationUI Test

This is a simple app for testing [Android Protected Confirmation](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-android-protected-confirmation), an Android feature supported by Pixel devices that is often overlooked on custom ROMs. It is also known as [ConfirmationUI](https://source.android.com/security/protected-confirmation), especially in the context of the underlying Android HALs.
